# embedded-systems-assignment
My submission for the Embedded Systems Programming AIMS CDT Course.

This repository contains implementations of algorithms to solve exactly determined systems in C++, Python, MATLAB and Python using Numpy. A report on the project is contained in Embedded_Systems_Lab_Report.pdf 

ESP_assignment_Cplusplus contains the C++ implementation of the algorithm, which is the main point of this assignment. This includes a Makefile and the source code (as well as potentially some .o files from the building process). The executable file after building ('make all' on a UNIX system) is named 'main'.

The python version of the algorithm is implemented in ESP_assigment_python and the MATLAB in MATLAB_solver.m. The numpy version is implemented in the jupyter notebook Visualization.ipynb.

clock_times contains the raw data for the time taken to solve the linear equations.
